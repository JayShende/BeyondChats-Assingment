# 🧠 Intercom UI Clone – BeyondChats Internship Assignment

This is a submission for the **ReactJS Development Internship** at **BeyondChats**. The project is a **fully responsive Intercom-style chat application**, closely modeled after the reference demo provided in the assignment brief.

Built using **Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI**, and **TanStack Query**, the application features both robust frontend UI and working backend message functionality via **Next.js API routes**, powered by **Prisma ORM** and a **PostgreSQL** database.

## 📣 Final Notes

This project was built with a **minimalist yet functional approach**, focused on **UI/UX, responsiveness, and feature replication**.

I went beyond just UI by implementing a **working backend** for message sending and retrieval using **Next.js API + Prisma**.

Components are **fully reusable**, **typed with TypeScript**, and organized for **scalability**.

Though animations were not prioritized, the **codebase is structured** for seamless enhancement later if needed.

## 🤝 Thanks

Thank you for the opportunity! I sincerely hope this submission demonstrates my **frontend development skills, attention to detail**, and the initiative to go beyond the UI by building a **functional and interactive application**.
